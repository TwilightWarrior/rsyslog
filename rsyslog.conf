# The statement between the begin ... end define a SINGLE forwarding
# rule. They belong together, do NOT split them. If you create multiple
# forwarding rules, duplicate the whole block!
# Remote Logging (we use TCP for reliable delivery)
#
# An on-disk queue is created for this action. If the remote host is
# down, messages are spooled to disk and sent when it is up again.

#$ActionQueueSaveOnShutdown on # save messages to disk on shutdown

# remote host is: name/ip:port, e.g. 192.168.0.1:514, port optional
